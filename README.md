# Professor-Rating-App

US Universities are one of the most diversified institutions we know of. Students here belong to different ethnicities, nationalities, cultural background, financial status and most importantly academic profiles. Students here have different intents behind pursuing higher education. Various independent case studies have revealed that most common reasons for choosing US universities are -
● Getting world renowned education
● Diverse academic choices and flexibility
● Career preparation: Optional Practical Training and employment opportunities
● Opportunity for Research

Varied reasons brings in different expectations from the academia. A graduate student majoring in computer science may want the courses be more practical and industry oriented whereas another student in same major may want the courses be taught more theoretically to enable him/her to zoom in on his/her subject of thesis.
Whether or not the expectation is met depends on each course‟s content; on the professor who is teaching it and upon other students in the class with whom the student often has to team up to accomplish group projects.
Even though professor and project team mate selection is of much importance for the academic success, students often find themselves running out of luck when it comes to making informed decisions. This is very problem we are intending to solve in our project. Our motto is- “Students should be able to make more informed choices about other students and professors”.
Our system addresses this issue by providing students with -
● Most relevant (course specific) reviews and ratings about a professor/student
● Personalized student/professor searches by providing a dynamic list of keywords to choose from.
